<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_16">Chapter 15 EEK-O-BLAST</h2>
<p class="c5">The EEK-O-BLAST EMPORIUM existed in the heart of
what appeared a domed stadium, filled with seats and tables,
holographic “rides” and competitive spectacles in which
participants could immerse themselves as much as they liked. The
whole thing was quite bewildering to me, as officials were
continually shouting out numbers in a most mystifying way. A
perfect pandemonium, the only respite from which I could find was
the hyböli that attendants were forever pressing into my hands.
After a few of these radiant beverages, my flagging spirits began
to rejuvenate and I observed more closely the activities of the
other participants.</p>
<p class="c5">They seemed to divide into cheering teams or
boosters, alternately bellowing forth a great din or cacophony. As
there were many holographic games taking place simultaneously
within the emporium, interminable stretches, where one could barely
hear oneself think, were punctuated by brief intermissions of
relative calm and quiet, lasting perhaps 30 seconds before the next
sonic wave was unleashed. I watched one of these activities with
fascination: holographic images of exotic creatures (a gazelle or
impala) sped across a landscape, as if all their sins were chasing
them. I grew bored with this after a few minutes, as there seemed
to be no point to the exercise; but others around me appeared to be
enjoying the creature’s flight, almost as if they anticipated some
outcome.</p>
<p class="c5">I had somehow lost track of Àkbä and began to search
for him. While I wandered around, someone handed me a tiny blue
wafer that resembled nothing so much as a contact lens. “Put it on
your tongue and let it dissolve,” the fellow said, pointing to his
mouth. ”What is it?” I said, not wanting to appear rustic or rude.
“Something like a mint?”</p>
<p class="c5">The fellow gave me a peculiar look and repeated:
“Yeah. A mint.” With that, he was gone. I put the dot in my mouth,
as he had suggested; but could taste nothing at all, certainly no
mint flavor.</p>
<p class="c5">When I caught up with my mentor, his face was bent
over a plate of polished obsidian; he appeared to be clearing his
throat. As he turned to me with a startled look, I could see a fine
substance resembling talcum powder on the tip of his nose and upper
lip. “Here, Sam. You should try some,” Àkbä solicited me with an
exaggerated grin and an exuberance I had seldom before seen in him.
Putting a thin tube of colored plastic like a straw up to one
nostril, “Hold it over the powder and sniff,” he instructed,
passing me the tube. Not one for halfway measures, I quickly
inhaled a thimble-full of the white powder up each nostril, then
turned to my tutor with a shrug. “I guess I don’t get it,” I
said.</p>
<p class="c5">“Don’t worry,” Àkbä said.</p>
<p class="c5">I watched with absorbed fascination, as a gigantic
earth-moving machine appeared to be devouring a mountainside. A
crowd had gathered around me to watch this exhibition, too. I
suddenly began to feel a superhuman rush of power and enormous
sense of elation, the likes of which I had rarely--if
ever--experienced. I thought of the lovemaking I had enjoyed with
Sylvia; I was reminded too of the immense satisfactions of putting
the final changes on a really good poem. But there was nothing
quite like the soaring and incendiary explosion that now seized my
brain and nervous system. I truly felt like a god.</p>
<p class="c5">I was about to ask my guide and mentor how this
emporium got its name when a woman in a state of disarray and
semi-nudity flew by at top speed, crying:
“Eeee-<em class="calibre3">eee-eeeek!</em>” Three or four Joracian men, whom I took
to be attendants, followed close on her heels. I did not see where
their chase ended. A few fistfights had also broken out; so Àkbä
proposed that we seize the opportunity to take our leave. I had
never before noticed that he was such a fast walker.</p>
