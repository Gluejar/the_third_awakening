<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_2">Chapter 1 New Stanley</h2>
<p class="c5">At the New Stanley I was standing at the far end of
the bar, mulling over my drink which I was using, with some
success, to perform a lobotomy. While so engaged, I wondered if it
wasn’t about time for the Vivaldi tape to come up again. As I stood
thinking this, a stranger came into the bar, strode up to me and
said: “Okay, it’s time.”</p>
<p class="c5">“Time for what,” I said, not bothering to look
up.</p>
<p class="c5">“Time for you to go,” he said.</p>
<p class="c5">“I have to finish my drink,” I offered without
interest.</p>
<p class="c5">“You have no drink,” the stranger curiously replied.
Suddenly I noticed that we appeared to be alone in the bar. My
glass was empty, clean and dry, as if it had never held a
drink.</p>
<p class="c5">“The Mother Ship’s waiting outside,” he added.</p>
<p class="c5">Ordinarily I would have found this scenario
terrifying, the stranger insolent; but somehow or other, the whole
thing sounded inviting. I had of late, it is true, become something
of a stranger to myself; I had been drinking heavily for weeks, I
know not for what collection of reasons. The bizarrely fashionable
articles I had been reading in the <em class="calibre3">Atlantic Monthly</em>
weighed heavily upon my mind. “Mustn’t keep Mother waiting,” I said
cheerily. But then, as is customary for me, I sought some last
minute excuse. Might I have a glass of water first? The water was
undrinkable, the stranger informed me. This was no surprise; I had
heard similar facts before, it seemed. Nevertheless I panicked.
Where was Sylvia? I had to talk to Sylvia.</p>
<p class="c5">“Sylvia’s in New York,” the stranger told me, with
an unmistakable note of weary disgust.</p>
