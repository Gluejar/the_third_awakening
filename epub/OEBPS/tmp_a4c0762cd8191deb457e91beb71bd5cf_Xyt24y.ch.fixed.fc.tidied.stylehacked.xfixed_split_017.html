<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_18">Chapter 17 Brutal Ardor</h2>
<p class="c5">No sooner had we boarded the mini-ship and sat down
at the controls than I felt my sense of purpose begin to veer.
Plotting my course, I formulated the words I wanted to use in my
mind and had started to open my mouth when I heard a voice warn:
“Don’t move, Sam.” There was a searing flash of light and a
crackling pop over my right shoulder as Àkbä vaporized in a gray
mist. I recognized the interloper’s voice. It was <em class="calibre3">Sylvia!</em>
I wanted to turn to see her; but a jab of cold steel at the nape of
my neck stopped me. Also: her tone of voice was—unfamiliar and
unwelcoming. “I thought—I thought you—” I stammered.</p>
<p class="c5">“Thought I was <em class="calibre3">dead?</em>”</p>
<p class="c5">Now I turned my head to look at her. But this was
not the Sylvia I had known. Sylvia was transformed. In her place
was a foreign creature, tall, dark and deadly serious. Clad in a
gray, close-fitting raiment, she wore black boots and a black cap
that covered her hair and ears. The old carefree Sylvia was gone;
the new Sylvia possessed a deliberate calm that infused and
informed all of her bodily movements. She also pointed a ray-gun
directly at my head.</p>
<p class="c5">“Sylvia, what’s happened to you?”</p>
<p class="c5">“Shut up, Earthnoid,” she ordered. “Get down on the
floor and stay where I can see you.”</p>
<p class="c5">Something told me I had better do as she
suggested.</p>
<p class="c5">She sat down at the controls. Her fingers played
across the console, plotting a course of her own.</p>
<p class="c5">“Where are we going?” I asked. No reply. Sylvia
continued working the console. I was vaguely aware of motion and
knew that we had been on our way for some time, when Sylvia broke
the silence.</p>
<p class="c5">“You’ve done quite well for yourself, haven’t you,
Little Man?” I couldn’t understand her tone; her coldness seemed to
be sheer calculated cruelty. Why was she treating me this way? I
was shocked and—well: hurt.</p>
<p class="c5">“You’re a traitor, Sam. Did you know that?” She must
have seen the shocked incredulity in my face. “No? I should shoot
you right now…”</p>
<p class="c5">But she didn’t shoot me. Instead, she related a
bizarre tale, the chronicle of her adventures since we had parted
so long ago in the Hall of Memory. “It’s the tale of my Great
Awakening to the true nature and agenda of Joracian Empire. To this
vast and glorious civilization for which you, it seems, have become
Chief Apologist and Lackey.”</p>
<p class="c5">I sat in unblinking disbelief but listened closely
to the story she related, a strange one to my ears.</p>
<p class="c5">“As soon as you had disappeared into your pod at the
Hall of Memory, Àkbä removed me from mine on a pretext of wanting
to show me something very important on the mini-ship. I blacked
out.</p>
<p class="c5">“When I woke up, my clothes were gone and I was
being ravished by a gang of Joracian males, chief among them your
pal, Àkbä. They’d given me some sort of drug… The sex wasn’t so
bad—ordinarily, I might not have minded but they weren’t very nice
about it.” Sylvia looked away as she said: “I don’t like being
forced.” Her tone of voice was so vapid that it scared me. There
was not a tear in her eye.</p>
<p class="c5">“After they’d finished with me, I was spirited away
to a place called the Basilica of Bimbos, where I was cleaned up,
body-painted, tattooed (with a flaccid Cock-&amp;-Balls emblem: the
Joracian logo!), perfumed and put on an auction block. The whole
place was a center for slave-trade, prostitution and drug-dealing.”
Sylvia played with her ray-gun, turning it this way and that in her
hand while she spoke. “These activities, by the way, Sam, are the
primary enterprises of your adopted Civilization, and the true
staples of the Joracian economy.”</p>
<p class="c5">After a brief pause, she resumed her narrative. “A
fat and wealthy Joracian named Trazmagor (he resembled Elvis in his
years of final, bloated decline) purchased me at auction. A real
piece of work, this Trazmagor, if you know what I mean. He used to
have me give him head while slaves packed his ass with cream cheese
before sodomizing him. Of course I was being sodomized by a male
slave at the same time, so what the hell!” Sylvia’s smile was not
pleasant to see. “This activity alternated with electroshocks,
which were delicately and unpredictably administered to every part
of my body—except the face. Traz had a thing about faces—by a
sadistic little twist named Nytåal…I got good and sizzled. Then it
was off to the cold showers, hot tub and steam room. The massage
was splendid, however. I actually began to look forward to being
raped and tortured because I knew the massage was coming…</p>
<p class="c5">“Trazmagor and I got to be pretty chummy after a
while. He let me in on some rather tasty tidbits about Joracian
Society. He not only explained Joracian customs to me, but actually
took me to places so I could see their beliefs and traditions in
action…”</p>
<p class="c5">She let this sink into my brain, which was pretty
numb by this time.</p>
<p class="c5">“You know what the real kicker is, Sam?” I shook my
head slowly. “The Joracians aren’t resettling any of the people
they evacuated from Earth. A few—the ‘lucky ones,’ I guess you
could call them—are sold, like I was, into prostitution and
slavery.”</p>
<p class="c5">Sylvia leaned forward and whispered to me in a most
disconcerting way: “Want to know what Joracians do with the rest of
’em?” Sylvia paused for dramatic effect—it worked. “Most are
systematically exterminated in Games held for the amusement of
elite Joracian sports enthusiasts. The rest participate in
something called ‘the Feast of the Ortho-Aesthetic Body’…”</p>
<p class="c5">“Joracians consume us, Sam.” Sylvia looked at her
weapon, then back at me. “They <em class="calibre3">EAT US!</em>”</p>
<p class="c5">There wasn’t much I could say to her. As much as I
didn’t want to believe it, I sensed somehow that the story Sylvia
was telling me was true. I was feeling pretty desolate, myself. I
finally got up the cheek to ask Sylvia a question.</p>
<p class="c5">“So, where are we heading now?”</p>
