<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_10">Chapter 9 First Assignment</h2>
<p class="c5">“Sam, I’m going to leave you with your first
resettlement group,” Àkbä informed me, once we were back inside the
mushroom. His hands carefully plotted our course, touching the
knobs and buttons and graphs of the console panel with the deft
touch of an experienced navigator. As he did so, he explained to me
how one went about navigating such a craft, where the maps of the
galaxies were stored in the Mother Ship’s memory, and how to locate
one’s place in each map. (“You Are Here,” each map proclaimed, a
little blinking mushroom noting the place, rather like a shopping
mall’s diagram.) “But I warn you, Sam…your fellow Earthlings are
confused and frightened. It will be no easy task to organize them.
But that is the task I charge you with now. You are at liberty to
share with them all that I have told you about the Joracian
Resettlement Plan—whatever will aid you in persuading them to come
on board.”</p>
<p class="c5">“Do I have access to any…materials?” I asked,
feeling a sudden sharp lack of confidence in my own abilities.</p>
<p class="c5">“The secrets are within you,” Àkbä said with a faint
smile. I felt his support growing inside me and I began to radiate
confidence. “If anybody can succeed in this venture, you can!”</p>
<p class="c5">All sense of fragile motion ceased. “Here we are,
good buddy. Good luck. I’ll be back in a couple days.” With that, I
felt a sudden vacancy or sense of separation and found myself
sitting in the corner of what felt like a large gymnasium. The
walls were dark mountains of shadow, and the time of day felt like
twilight. At the far end of the gym huddled a crowd of maybe fifty
or sixty humans, their long purple shadows touching my feet. A few
in that crowd noticed my presence. They began to shout and point;
soon everyone was crowding around me, yelling and pointing. “Who is
he? Is he one of them? Let’s kill him!”</p>
<p class="c5">I could see I had my work cut out for me.</p>
<p class="c5">First, I introduced myself to them. I gave it to
them as straight as I knew how. “Earth is past. Finished. It’s
history.” If we’re going to survive in our new world, I explained,
we would have to acquire some new skills, and a new outlook. “The
Joracians took us out of geo-context because it was no longer
healthy for us.” I described the Resettlement Plan, how all of us
were scattered in myriad colonies all across the universe, arranged
by kinship ties and scent. The Joracians were willing to share the
secrets of their advanced peaceful civilization—safe technology,
telepathy and more!—but we would have to organize and develop
ourselves, our… consciousness. “Our destiny now is in our own
hands. But we must be willing to prepare, to develop ourselves,
to–to learn to work in teams.”</p>
<p class="c5">“What sort of work?” one fellow asked, a sneer and a
raspy cough of a voice. I could see he might be trouble.</p>
<p class="c5">“Creative work. Self-discovery, development, you
know. Trying to be a better person. A–and poetry. Any kind of
writing, really—”</p>
<p class="c5">“What did you say your name was?”</p>
<p class="c5">“Marz,” I said. “Sam Marz.”</p>
<p class="c5">“You’re as full of shit as a Christmas goose, Sam
Marz!”</p>
<p class="c5">I just looked him in the eye and said nothing; but I
did not smile.</p>
<p class="c5">There was a moment or two of uncomfortable muttering
among the others; then a woman spoke up:</p>
<p class="c5">“I believe you, Sam.” She turned to the others—a
woman maybe in her late forties—and said: “He’s right. There’s
nothing for us on Earth any more. We’ve got to do what he
says.”</p>
<p class="c5">A considerable discussion of this last point ensued,
with many voices participating; some old, some young, men and
women—hell, we even had a few teenagers. I suggested that we all
sit down in a loose semicircle, with me facing the half-circle of
people. We gave ourselves enough room so we could sort of stretch
out and be halfway comfortable, you know, and then…we started to
talk, one at a time, introducing ourselves, where we hailed from
back on Earth, and what our lives had been like. It was a varied
group, too, with some blue-collar workers, firemen and policemen,
some college professors, some retail business types, and
secretaries, a veterinarian, a lawyer, some housewives, a
taxidermist, and even a lifeguard! A wonderful group; and as soon
as the first wave of disclosure slowed, I taught them a simple
meditation to help them relax and acclimate themselves to our new
adventure. Introducing them to the child within themselves, we
imagined a safe and secret place in a forest, in the mountains, by
the sea—wherever they wanted to be, really, the first place that
came to mind—where they might like to create a sanctuary…and so the
first meeting came to a close. I suggested that perhaps we should
all rest for a few hours.</p>
<p class="c5">The group had gotten to its feet, and a few
individuals were milling around at the edges of the gym, when
somebody yelled: “Hey, look here: there’s food!” And sure enough,
there was a long table laden with boxed dinners of cold fried
chicken, cole slaw, potato salad and two huge vats of iced tea. I
suggested we form two lines to take advantage of this unexpected
feast in an orderly fashion. I asked one of the girls to help me
serve the iced tea; and we waited until everybody else had received
their dinner and drinks before we served ourselves. Her name was
Kim and she was from Springfield, Illinois. We sat down to share a
meal and get acquainted.</p>
<p class="c5">“Where are you from?” she asked, after we had eaten
a few mouthfuls of fried chicken.</p>
<p class="c5">“Missouri,” I told her; I had lived in Kansas City,
Missouri. “I was born in Philadelphia but I grew up in St. Louis. I
moved to Kansas City after college.”</p>
<p class="c5">“I had some family in Kansas City,” Kim told me: her
only sister and brother-in-law. “They really like—liked it.”</p>
<p class="c5">“Kansas City was a very friendly place. Nice
people,” I replied. St. Louis, by contrast, was rather stodgy and
patrician. But I said nothing to Kim about this. If you can’t say
something positive, after all, it’s really better not to talk.</p>
<p class="c5">“I wonder where they are—?” Kim asked and suddenly,
an icy chasm yawned between us: she looked bewildered and tiny. “Is
this going to be all right?”</p>
<p class="c5">“Everything’s going to be just fine, Kim. Don’t you
worry.” The degree of reassurance in my tone of voice surprised
even me.</p>
<p class="c5">As we finished eating our fill and pushed the boxed
debris aside, it seemed to disappear. The space we occupied had
grown darker and darker; we could no longer see or hear the
others.</p>
<p class="c5">“Kim?” I leaned forward, peering hard to make out
her face, when I noticed that my clothes had dissolved, and I was
lying on my back with a huge, throbbing erection! Kim crawled up on
top of me, naked as the day she was born, and began kissing me on
the lips as she swayed back and forth, rocking her hips slowly at
first but with steadily increasing momentum. I cupped her large
breasts (Kim was small but well-endowed) with my hands, licked her
nipples, kissed her lips wildly, ferociously inserting my tongue
deep into her hot red orifice, kissed her chin, her forehead,
temples and eyelids.</p>
<p class="c5">“Ooh, lover, it’s <em class="calibre3">soo-oooh</em> good!” Kim
crooned in a husky voice.</p>
<p class="c5">I grabbed her love handles gently but firmly and
began thrusting her down, faster and faster, on the rapidly
approaching crescendo of our passion.</p>
<p class="c5">The moment, when it came, was like that pause
between a nuclear explosion and the eerie billowing of a mushroom
cloud: it seemed to last an eternity, then it was quickly over and
everything became qualitatively different. Kim had collapsed on top
of me and we lay panting and dripping with sweat in each other’s
arms.</p>
<p class="c5">Our reprieve was brief. A second libidinal formation
soon followed the first, as Kim—who, in our copulatory dénouement,
had rolled off to the side—began to stir. She clambered between my
legs and seized the purple tube in her hands, her hot little tongue
behaving like a strange foraging animal, independent and
single-minded, oblivious to all but its own inescapable instinct.
Kim was insatiable: her tongue and its devotions were driving me
crazy! When I could bear it no longer, I pulled her off me and,
rising to my knees, mounted her from behind. We joined in a
repetitive, thrusting maneuver, bouncing her off my groin. It was
exhilarating and seemed to go on indefinitely. A short gasp,
followed by a kind of whispered wheeze, elicited from Kim, as her
torso eased forward and down, her arms outstretched. So we
continued, throughout the night…</p>
<p class="c5">When I awoke, Kim was cradled in my arms asleep,
where she had spent the night. I was relieved to find us both
dressed. She opened an eye. “Sweet dreams?” I asked. The corners of
Kim’s mouth curled up in a smile. “Dream of the apples,” she
whispered.</p>
<p class="c5">A breakfast of fruit and juice, whole grain cereals
and skim milk, fresh-baked wheat and raisin bagels, coffee and
non-dairy creamer was prepared for us and waiting, just as dinner
had been the night before. After a leisurely meal, it was time for
me to get down to work.</p>
