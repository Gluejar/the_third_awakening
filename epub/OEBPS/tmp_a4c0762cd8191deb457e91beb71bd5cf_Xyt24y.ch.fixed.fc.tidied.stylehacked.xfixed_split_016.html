<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_17">Chapter 16 After Hours</h2>
<p class="c5">We returned to the Club, which surprised me. It was
surely very late. “It’s After Hours now,” Àkbä told me with a
sophisticated wink. I sensed that we were about to share a
delightful experience. No sooner had we arrived than we were met by
a luscious and sexy young nymph, who soon divested us of our attire
and led me by the hand deep into hidden recesses of the recreation
center, cloaked in murky shadows of a weak blue light.</p>
<p class="c5">She quickly discovered the bulge at my crotch and,
as we sank to the soft cushioning of the playing floor, began
attending to its pleasure with inspired Rabelaisian zest. I fully
expected her to climb on top and slip down over my serviceable
member at any moment; surprisingly, she persisted in these
delectations of her tongue and lips until her studied attention
resulted in an ear-flushing, temple-pounding eruption. Even so, she
did not remove my supple protuberance but continued her ceremony
until I sank back, unable to restrain a tremendous sigh of
relief.</p>
<p class="c5">“Ice wallow,” she said cryptically. I closed my eyes
for a few moments, dozing off. When I awoke, I could smell the
spicy steam of a hot tub nearby and quickly made my way to it. So
thick were the shadows all around me, I could not make out another
soul but only the vaguest hint or outline of other shapes. The tub
seemed abandoned as I sank gradually into its bubbling, frothy
water. But I soon discovered I was wrong.</p>
<p class="c5">Arms encircled my waist, hot breath at my neck and
ears, and soft plump breasts rubbing against my shoulder blades
signified that I had, once again, fallen into the clutches of
another denizen of the Joracian Erotic Zone. This marvelous seraph
slipped her hands down my sides, slowly, below the water, reached
around for my newly-acquired erection, which she took gently in
both hands, pressing her pudendum hard against my coccyx. Leaning
forward, she licked my ear with her tongue. “Come with me. The
Sauna!”</p>
<p class="c5">I did as she bid me. We raced, hand-in-hand, around
a little corner to a massive cedar door, which this houri pushed
open with ease. Inside, she disappeared in a thick fog of steam; I
felt my pores open as never before. We kissed long and
lasciviously; then, as I lay back on a wide wooden bench, she
climbed on top of me, easing herself with a practiced precision
over and around my blood-gorged, hydraulic pump.</p>
<p class="c5">I was used to mutual pleasure-taking with Sylvia;
but never before had I encountered anything like the succubus I was
now tupping. After massaging her Molly with the great iguana
heaving at my groin, this exotic demoness began gloriously writhing
and, at the apex of her lust, seized my head with both hands
(gently tugging and massaging my hair and scalp with her canny
fingers), pressing her lips hard against mine, her wet hot tongue
exploring the inside of my mouth. Wave after wave of excitement
rolled over us, taking me to new peaks of ecstasy. My expectations
were not disappointed: we came together ferociously, she and I,
sweat pouring off us in torrents. My heart was pounding fiercely in
my chest when she suggested we go for a swim.</p>
<p class="c5">I had not known such a thing was available in
Joracian society (Àkbä had never mentioned it). But the pool to
which my partner now led me was like nothing I might have
anticipated. A huge spherical container, open at the top (“Like a
goldfish bowl!” I exclaimed), nearly filled the vaulted chamber.
Naked figures of men and women hung suspended, moving effortlessly
and slow, in the transparent blue liquid that filled the container.
Ladders rose to the top; we scaled them now. Once at the top, she
dove in and I watched with amazement as she penetrated the
marvelous fluid. Wasting no time, I stepped off the edge…</p>
<p class="c5">The substance I found myself suspended in was not
like water or any other liquid with which I had been acquainted on
earth. While it had some of the properties of water, it felt much,
<em class="calibre3">much</em> lighter: one virtually glided at will through the
rippling gauzy aether. Another property of this curious substance
took me by surprise.</p>
<p class="c5">“It isn’t water,” my consort said; and the strange
sound and timbre of her voice amazed me. Even more amazing was the
fact that her mouth had been open the whole time she spoke. “It’s a
special element called <em class="calibre3">esval borla fedomer</em>. It’s
breathable.” After some hesitation, I quit holding my breath.</p>
<p class="c5">“Bizarre sensation,” I said, a slight tingling in my
lungs, like butterflies in one’s alveoli. Or the feeling one had as
a child at Christmas time.</p>
<p class="c5">Even as this thought occurred, we had begun to
discover new games. Perhaps due to the physical sensations afforded
by the wondrous medium, my erection returned: I now penetrated my
juicy cherub’s posterior just as her mouth and tongue found the
hard pole of a young Joracian male. Transported through this
flowing sublime, I saw that other naked bodies were engaged in
similar frolic and sex-play, couples and trios and--to my
astonishment!--at least one quartet. Each group seemed oblivious to
all the others; and I soon returned to the soft buttocks of the
creature whose hips I held firmly in my hands, unable to
distinguish my pelvic thrusts from the zesty shaking of her bottom
against the stiff spar of my lust. Greedily, I remained for what
seemed (but could not have been!) hours until, at last exhausted by
our vigorous sport, we crawled out of the gaseous orb and descended
the ladder, our bodily surfaces dry as a bone.</p>
<p class="c5">If these erotic discoveries had come unexpectedly,
the diversions that consumed the rest of the evening were a
revelation. Settling down on soft, buoyant cushions in the deep
shadows of the main room, nubile maidens brought us additional
refreshments, of both liquid and solid variety. Somewhere a deep
gong sounded, and a presence of some authority suddenly announced:
“<em class="calibre3">Clej Ameo</em> is an Ideal of Service!” His voice was briefly
drowned out by excited whispers and mutterings. When they subsided,
the spokesman continued. “An Ideal of Service we shall now ALL
EXPERIENCE—<em class="calibre3">IN FULL!</em>”</p>
<p class="c5">My hyböl was taking effect. I relaxed back into the
soft cushions supporting me and wondered what new treat might be in
store. I did not have to wait long.</p>
<p class="c5">A group of naked beauties were paraded before us; In
the pale blue glow illuminating the room, I could just make out
that their hands seemed tied by some light yet tensile braid and
that these females were chained together. I watched with growing
anticipation as they formed a circle, with breasts and pudendum
facing out towards their onlookers. From the distance at which I
sat, their faces projected a kind of feral excitement, as if
sensing that their aroused hunger was about to be satiated.</p>
<p class="c5">Suppressing a wild thrill, I took a sip of my hyböl.
A passing concubine offered me several consciousness-enhancers from
a tray that she held beneath her fine bulbous tits (”Thanks ever so
much, darling!” and I licked one of her nipples before she turned
away). Suddenly, an army of over-stimulated Joracian males, worked
into a frenzy of lust, swarmed over the stage from all directions,
each one having his way in turn with the captive thralls. In fact,
the pleasure-slaves were no longer visible but had disappeared
entirely under the frenzied pack of males, their ravished cries (of
unimaginable pleasure!) nearly drowned out by the clamoring jeers,
taunts, snarls and boasts of their irresistible masters.</p>
<p class="c5">“C’mon,” Àkbä urged, tugging my elbow, having
suddenly appeared out of nowhere. “It’s <em class="calibre3">your turn</em>,
Sam!”</p>
<p class="c5">I tried to offer an excuse, claiming that I had
perhaps overdone it with the hyböli and other chemical “enhancers”
I had consumed during the course of the day. But there was no
refusing him.</p>
<p class="c5">As we approached our ensnared quarry, I felt a
stiffening sense of purpose. A bit bleary-eyed with all the
exertion, I approached one lithe consort who sank to her knees with
eyes closed (so reverently did she approach her duties!),
performing a splendid fellatio on me at once. Intuiting her boredom
or fatigue before she finished, I withdrew from her mouth-watering
devices and slapped my porpoise into her with an exuberant
solicitude that, by this time, had become second nature. My
encouragement thrilled her, for she hooked her long lithe legs
tightly about my waist, locking her heels together, even raising
her knees to my ribs to show how much she was enjoying herself.</p>
<p class="c5">As I reached a bone-rattling climax, I noticed Àkbä
(who had turned his aroused chattel over and was jamming his
engorged member into her anus) slowly raising his head, his lips
covered with blood. I wondered exhaustedly how he had managed to
injure himself.</p>
<p class="c5">Pulling me away from our carnal sacrament, he
mumbled through numb lips: “Let’s get out of here.”</p>
<p class="c5">After a quick shower and a change of garments, we
headed for the mini-ship. Something was bothering me, a vague
irritation that I could not quite put my finger on, like cosmic
cockroaches gnawing steadily away at the edges of the Universe. I
made up my mind to ask my Joracian pal a few questions once we
returned to the ship.</p>
