<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_5">Chapter 4 Poetry</h2>
<p class="c5">We were joined by a new figure, whom Àkbä introduced
to me as Brôk. “This is the Earthling I wanted you to meet.” Brôk
did something I was not ready for: pointing an index finger at each
temple, he bowed from the waist. “Pleased to meetcha,” I said, a
bit numb. “The pleasure is ours, I can assure you,” Brôk said, his
diplomacy not missing a beat.</p>
<p class="c5">“He’s a poet,” Àkbä disclosed in a hushed tone to
Brôk, to my consternation. This piece of intelligence was received
by Brôk with the same sanctity one might presume would accompany a
hot investment tip. Brôk had much the same reaction as any Earthman
who is invited, unexpectedly, to a beautiful woman’s boudoir in
order to peruse the larger meaning of certain passages in Blake or
who is told he has just inherited a million dollars—that is to say,
Brôk’s eyes grew wide with delight. Needless to say, I was
puzzled.</p>
<p class="c5">Àkbä later explained to me that, of all the various
occupations and professions to which the race of mortal Earthlings
was prone, poets were the most highly esteemed; this was a constant
throughout the Universe, to which Earth seemed to be the sole
exception. Nowhere else in the Universe, he stressed, was poetry
produced, although it was greatly appreciated; in certain
prestigious quarters of this cosmos, he insisted, poetry was
considered to be the distinctive trait of human beings, the very
flower of Earth. However, he hastily added, this was true of poets
strictly insofar as they concerned themselves with the creation of
beautiful objects, with the production of poems. This too, it
seemed to me, had a quasi-familiar ring to it.</p>
<p class="c5">Along these lines, he was able to tell me something
about Joracian Society, which has three social classes. The First,
and lowest, Level is composed of bureaucrats, basically political
types. The Second Level, which devotes itself exclusively to
meaningless and archaic ritual, resembles nothing so much as what
we call religion. The Third Level has no translatable analog, but
most closely resembles poetry and the behavior of poets—except, of
course, that it would never occur to a Joracian to actually make a
poem.</p>
<p class="c5">“What do members of your class do?” I asked
Àkbä.</p>
<p class="c5">“We handle all Communications,” he answered.</p>
<p class="c5">“What are you going to do with all of us?” I
inquired.</p>
<p class="c5">“After dividing you by kinship ties and scent, we
plan to resettle you in colonies all over the Universe.” As he
related the Plan, everybody would have at least some of the people
they had known and loved back on Earth in their colony, but not all
of them. For example, a brother or sister might share a life in a
new colony with one another, but their father or mother would
inhabit a colony perhaps a billion light-years away. The Joracians
who researched the evacuation of Earth had access to mountains of
human dream-data for each individual; the Joracian teams had their
priorities straight in choosing the principles of composition for
each colony. “We tried to respect everyone’s Unconscious,” Àkbä
mentioned quixotically. Possibly, distant relatives and loved ones
might be permitted to visit each other; certainly they would
communicate. We would just have to adopt a “wait and see policy,”
he said. “That is where the poets will come in handy,” Àkbä
deduced.</p>
<p class="c5">I asked what he meant.</p>
<p class="c5">“If the Resettlement Program is to be successful, we
are going to desperately need your support and assistance.”</p>
<p class="c5">This sounded pretty vague, so I was relieved when he
got more explicit.</p>
<p class="c5">“Earth is gone, you may as well face it. The entire
framework, secular and political, which made events and actions
meaningful—all is vanished! If human beings are to avoid becoming
extinct, they will have to be retooled for a higher activity and
purpose. The seeds of which, it just so happens, are embedded in
your world’s art and literature.”</p>
<p class="c5">Uh-huh, I thought: Right. At that moment, I felt as
if I knew precisely what he was talking about.</p>
<p class="c5">“You, my dear friend, are going to help us to
replant those seeds.”</p>
