<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_6">Chapter 5 Vivaldi!</h2>
<p class="c5">Àkbä told me a great many other things: that
Joracians had discovered a way of living in total peace and harmony
(they had not had a war in 100,000,000 years), that they were
telepathic, that they could easily teach former Earthlings these
skills. Meanwhile, we sped across galaxies, nearing our
destination.</p>
<p class="c5">We emerged from the big green mushroom directly into
the interior structure of the main building of what was to be my
new home. I mentioned the blackout I experienced while boarding the
craft back on Earth, and now asked Àkbä what our means of
locomotion had been.</p>
<p class="c5">“Telekinesis,” he replied.</p>
<p class="c5">“Tele…?”</p>
<p class="c5">“Just like <em class="calibre3">Star Trek</em>,” he said, somewhat
condescendingly.</p>
<p class="c5">He escorted me to an intimate space, the walls and
ceiling of which seemed a kind of free-floating, gauzy, curtainy
substance; this substance appeared to be blowing, almost breathing.
The chamber was outfitted with a green coal like the one I had seen
on the spacecraft.</p>
<p class="c5">“This will be your sleeping quarters for the
present. An attendant will see to your dining preference when it is
time. Everything from the National Voice Library, Library of
Congress and University of Texas at Austin will be placed at your
disposal. I leave you now to your rest and rejuvenation. But first,
a surprise for you.” With that, he was gone!</p>
<p class="c5">Through the gauzy, blowing curtain came a tumbling
figure I was delighted to see.</p>
<p class="c5">“Sylvia!” No sooner had I spoken her name than we
were in each other’s arms, a greeting that quickly blossomed into
serious kissing.</p>
<p class="c5">“New York was <em class="calibre3">hor</em>rible,” Sylvia said. “I
mean, I went to this party, and it was okay, but everyone was so
cold…” Her voice trailed off as she began to consider her
surroundings. “Sam,” she whispered. “What are we <em class="calibre3">on</em>?”</p>
<p class="c5">“Didn’t the fellows from outer space explain
things?”</p>
<p class="c5">“I thought they were from New Jersey!”</p>
<p class="c5">This was going to take some time, I could see at
once. But first, Sylvia and I had more pressing business to attend
to. “Come here,” I said, taking her hand in mine. We knelt down
beside the green coal. To my amazement, as we kissed, our garments
began melting away.</p>
<p class="c5">“You think it’s okay, Sam—I mean—here?” she asked, a
sigh of paranoia.</p>
<p class="c5">“It’s our bedroom,” I declared. “We can get
something to eat later.”</p>
<p class="c5">“Great, I’m starved!”</p>
<p class="c5">“So am I!” With that, an uncontrollable bout of
kissing broke out, as down Hedon’s slippery slope we both commenced
to slide. Gradually falling into other routines, I began to notice
a familiar sound washing all around us.</p>
<p class="c5">“Vivaldi,” Sylvia crooned, a wet velvet slurp in my
ear.</p>
<p class="c5">“It’s about time!”</p>
