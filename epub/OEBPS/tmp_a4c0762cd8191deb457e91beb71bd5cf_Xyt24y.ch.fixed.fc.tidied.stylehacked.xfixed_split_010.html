<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_11">Chapter 10 Mini-Ship</h2>
<p class="c5">The time passed quickly during the next few weeks.
Working at a feverish pace, I arranged the entire group into small
cells of four or five persons. I shared what little I knew of
philosophy and poetry in order to help them achieve a heightened
awareness and sensitivity to each other and to themselves. Within
the first few days, an elite of nobility began to shine forth as
certain individuals, picking up my drift, took on natural roles of
leadership; and the whole project began to blossom beyond my
wildest hopes and dreams. Some of it, at first, was like
psychotherapy process group work, with persons encountering—some
for the first time in their lives, no doubt—their own acquired,
unreflected defenses. There was quite a lot of confession and
sobbing as one man, who had been a policeman on Earth, recounted
his abusive childhood and the father whose cruelty—cloaked behind
sham robes of authority—he’d been made to idolize: this man had
killed a prisoner, the crime gone undetected all these years; yet
he confessed it openly to us.</p>
<p class="c5">In no time at all, everyone was really working at
self-realization, grappling with their actual, unresolved childhood
issues, identifying and locating the inner child of his or her
authentic self. As I consulted daily with my trusted lieutenants,
Sharon and Ted and Kim, scheduling our plans for monitoring and
spurring on this wonderful work, I began to have a vivid sense of
what Plato’s Academy in ancient Athens must have been like: a
gathering whose sole purpose lay in discovering and speaking the
truth, through a disciplined and passionate conversation. Kim was
especially a source of great pride and pleasure to me: under our
communal tutelage, she had lost her feign of vacillating confusion,
become extraordinarily self-possessed, a graceful, eloquent
woman-warrior and poet.</p>
<p class="c5">As I was meditating on my future plans for us, a
seminar on Being and Knowledge, Àkbä appeared before me. “Well
done, Sam,” he said. The group had vanished; Àkbä explained that
they were being teleported to new frontiers where they could carry
on with other Earthlings the work for which they had been so well
prepared. He had met with other Joracians on the Council; so
successful had been my little “experiment”—Àkbä used this term, he
emphasized, to indicate just how tentative and skeptical some of
his race had been about my chances of success!—that the Council had
decided unanimously to use it as the model for the whole
Intergalactic Resettlement Project. In short, I was being
promoted.</p>
<p class="c5">“You will henceforth visit all of the colonies,
overseeing the process of coordination and initiating new recruits.
You will monitor the growth work you have instigated, performing
special training as necessary,” Àkbä announced. “I have been
authorized to present you with a new uniform, one which bears the
Insignia of Imperial Splendor,” he added in a hushed tone, a tear
glistening in his eye. “This is the highest recognition of merit
and most sacred honor my world can bestow.” Even as he spoke, I
felt my raiment undergo a sea-change, my old blue suit with the
lightning-patch fell away and I stood enrobed in a radiant white
gown, a purple cape and a truly boffo cap, adorned at the tippy-top
by what seemed like a propeller (except it didn’t move). My old
shoes were transformed into shiny, azure boots; a gold chain and
medallion hung around my neck. I looked at the medallion later, but
I couldn’t figure out the Insignia at all; except to see that it
was obviously a cross between a hologram and The Miracle Picture of
Jesus—you know, the one where the eyes seem to follow you when you
walk across the room? If I held it at an angle, it looked like a
few vaguely curved lines painted on black velvet, reminiscent of a
flaccid cock-and-balls; but shift the angle of the medallion ever
so slightly, and this was replaced by what resembled nothing so
remotely as a gigantic, ornate capital “A”. I soon realized that
these devices were as nonobjective as those sublime images I had
earlier seen on the walls of the basilica at the Palace of
Justice.</p>
<p class="c5">Now I stood in the warmth of Àkbä’s glowing words.
“No non-Joracian has ever received such an honor, Sam.” I was
speechless. “With it comes great power.” He turned and, with a wave
of his arm, showed a green mushroom standing a few yards away. “The
mini-ship is yours. It will take you wherever in this Universe you
desire to go. It is fully provisioned and programmed with
navigation instruments, libraries of data from Earth, and can
easily accommodate a dozen guests. The coordinates are preset for
all your work sites.” He took me on a brief tour of the ship, and
we spent the next thirty minutes or so going over the controls,
navigational devices, maps and other equipment and information that
I would need on my journeys. Àkbä provided detailed and explicit
explanations of everything pertaining to the mini-ship, its
maintenance and safe use. There were also online manuals and help
at the touch of a button. A sense of gratitude overwhelmed me; and
I flushed at the interest, concern and care my friend and tutor had
shown me.</p>
<p class="c5">“Great power brings with it even greater
responsibility,” Àkbä said. “But it also bestows privilege. It is
high time that you were initiated into the Mysteries, Sam.” At
this, everything began getting grayer and grayer and grayer until
finally, I blacked out altogether…</p>
