<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_7">Chapter 6 Jambalya</h2>
<p class="c5">Through misty veils of sleep, I thought I heard a
voice say, “Yo’ Jambahlayah is served!” Groggily we rose, our eyes
half-closed. The aroma of filet gumbo was overpowering. Someone had
left steaming covered dishes on trays. Tall carafes held some
chilled beverage, two fluted wine glasses beside them. “Sylvia,” I
murmured gently in my love’s ear, “It’s dinner.” Removing a silver
cover, I began to drool, suddenly realizing I was famished. Sylvia
was soon beside me, raising a forkful to her dainty mouth. As I
pigged out, making yummy sounds, Sylvia poured some of the liquid
into our glasses. I watched as she sipped, pursing her lips in a
little smile, her eyes all but closing. “It’s Asti,” she declared.
“My favorite.”</p>
<p class="c5">Famished, we ate like pigs. Our repast continued in
delighted silence for some time, broken only by sounds of animal
satisfaction. When we had finished the food, or eaten all we could
(the portions were magnificent; but I always try to stop eating
whenever I feel just right), we sat back stupefied, our hands
cradling our bellies. Then, to my surprise, Sylvia and I both let
out a terrific belch simultaneously, and burst into laughter
together. Sated, Sylvia found she was restless. “Let’s go
exploring, Sam.” As we crept toward the portal, we were wearing the
uniform of the Joracian High Command. She tried the door. “Coast is
clear,” she said, grinning.</p>
<p class="c5">“This way,” I said, looking down the left hall. A
guard was posted before a prominent-looking entrance. As I
approached, this guard pointed to his temples in the same strange
manner as Brôk had done. Before he could straighten up, though, we
had passed through the double doorway.</p>
<p class="c5">It took awhile for our eyes to grow accustomed to
the light. Sparkling, shimmering lights revolved around the walls
of the room. There was sound too, a pulsating rhythm and a bass
voice (or was it baritone?) that drove the music; it seemed I’d
heard it before but all I could think of was: the <em class="calibre3">Orson Welles
of Rhythm-&amp;-Blues</em>. “Sylvia,” I said, “Where are you?” I
couldn’t see a thing. Steaming mists rose off the central edifice,
which gradually emerged, capturing my attention. “Sam,” Sylvia
cried, “it’s a hot tub!” By the time we reached the edge of the
tub, our clothes had magically dissolved.</p>
<p class="c5">Sylvia was ravishing; her body had never looked so
beautiful. We stood together, feeling the bubbles procreate around
us, our hands discovering the surface of our bodies as if for the
first time, arms encircling each other’s waist, drawing our lips
and the centers of our bodies together hard, with a slapping sound.
But before our lovemaking could begin in earnest, Sylvia hunkered
down into the water, only her nose, mouth and eyes showing above
the water line. I could see that something was on her mind.</p>
<p class="c5">“Sam,” her brows furrowed, “do you like this
place?”</p>
<p class="c5">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="c5">“I don’t know. These Joracians—I don’t trust
them.”</p>
<p class="c5">“They’ve taken on the job of relocating all of
Earth’s inhabitants. I think we have to trust them.”</p>
<p class="c5">“Do you think we’re all right here?”</p>
<p class="c5">I explained to Sylvia, as best I could, that the
Joracians were, from all I could gather, our very good friends and
that, on the whole, I believed their plan for evacuating Earth an
environmentally sound one indeed. I suppose I must have gotten a
bit long-winded. Suddenly, the water seemed very hot to me. Sylvia
had, on the contrary, grown colder. She had moved away from me as I
spoke and now sat sulking at the far edge of the tub, her knees
drawn up to her perky little chin. “What’s the matter?” I asked.
“I’m sure you’re right!” she snapped back. “It’s just—well, it all
seems a little…too good to be true?” I remember thinking: downright
preposterous; but I never said a word. I drifted with the moment
instead, letting Nature take its course. That’s what Laotzu said to
do; and I fancied myself something of a Taoist.</p>
<p class="c5">Sylvia seemed to grow more distant with each passing
moment. It was just one of her moods. “We better get out,” I said.
I don’t remember dressing. But no sooner had we crawled back
through that steamy fog than we found each other, plain as day,
dressed just the way we came.</p>
<p class="c5">“Far out,” I muttered.</p>
