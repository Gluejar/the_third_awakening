<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_13">Chapter 12 Colonies</h2>
<p class="c5">I visited colony after colony, outpost after
outpost, explaining to the Earthlings in each instance the nature
of their newfound situation, and launching the work of recovery and
restoration with single-minded passion. I soon became quite adept
at spotting leadership potential among the evacuees, selecting team
leaders to assist in our work. I was always amazed at how quickly
they would take to my suggestions, pursuing the path of
self-enlightenment and growth—often with a commitment that rivaled
my own. Together, we replaced the old ingrained patterns of
ideology and timeserving productivity with poetry and a love of
discovering the Truth through communal dialogue.</p>
<p class="c5">Soon, I took to rewarding my lieutenants with
special junkets in the mini-ship. We’d visit the hot tubs and the
Temple of Fitness; I was delighted to share the experiences I’d had
with new generations. On one occasion, I was in the hot tub with
Kirstin, a lanky beauty with blue eyes, sipping hyböls and
listening to Bill Evans. I opened one eye and admired Kirstin’s
short sandy hair and the fine lilt of her perfect tits, the nipples
slightly upturned. She asked me what it was like the first time I
went to the Temple of Fitness. I described it for her as well as I
could, the erotic quality, the sublime interchanging of body parts.
Up to this point I had only allowed one person at a time on our
junkets, occupying the others elsewhere. During her first
experience, a young demigod named Zoltan, with whom she had shared
a hierophany similar to mine, had met Kirstin.</p>
<p class="c5">“I wonder,” Kirstin mused, “what it would be like if
several of us went in <em class="calibre3">together</em>?” As if suddenly aroused by
the mere suggestion, Kirstin pressed close, kissing my lips, and
gently giving my swollen knob short rhythmic tugs below the
waterline. Aroused, we exited the tub and I lay back, while Kirstin
performed an unforgettable cadenza on my skin flute. Without a
word, she eased herself down onto my lap with a squishy sigh,
wrapping her long legs around my waist, placing her palms down upon
my shoulders. I held her face in my hands, felt the coarse locks of
her sandy hair in my fingers, and looked into those China blue eyes
while we fucked, naturally and unabashedly. “Maybe you could bring
some of your Joracian friends, too.” “It might be fun,” I agreed
as, clenching, she grabbed me fiercely, her arms encircling my
back, holding me tightly as we both started to come…</p>
<p class="c5">By the end of my probationary period, Àkbä decided
it was time that I became more intimate with the particulars of
Joracian Culture. There were a dozen or more fundamental principles
investing the Joracian belief-system, all more or less
interchangeable and somewhat fuzzy; but the whole thing seemed to
be based upon Desire and Confidence, which Joracians possessed in
abundance, and all heavily tinged with eroticism. From an early
age, Joracians were trained to visualize images of what they
desired, as a first step toward bringing the desired object into
being. At the same time, Joracians were the least materialistic of
all persons I have ever known. “Ownership” was utterly foreign to
them; Àkbä, for example, owned little more than the clothes on his
back. Marriage was equally unknown to Joracian males and females,
who used each other for sexual purposes as the spirit moved them.
The individual alone was sacrosanct and inviolate.</p>
<p class="c5">Children belonged to the communal society. Joracians
held Education, the acquisition of knowledge for its own sake,
technical competence and the widening of horizons, to be sacred.
“We Joracians are a race of Discoverers,” Àkbä often said, “always
seeking new worlds to explore.” Joracians, though they had no
family life as such, loved children. When I mentioned to Àkbä that
I had never seen any Joracian children, he laughed: “That’s because
they’re always away at school.” Joracians viewed all failures and
setbacks as opportunities to be seized and transformed by
persistence and creativity into resounding successes. “No true
Joracian ever fails,” my mentor instructed.</p>
<p class="c5">According to Àkbä, Joracians believed desire to be
the ultimate core of the universe, identical with energy, and all
principles one with that of sexual desire. Yet, a strange
asceticism permeated Joracian culture in the form of something
called <em class="calibre3">Clej Ameo</em>, which the whole society viewed as more
precious than success. It could not be literally translated into
English. But listening to Àkbä talk about it, I soon gathered from
context that it represented something like an ideal of loyalty or
love.</p>
<p class="c5">On our next junket, seven of us arrived at the
Temple of Fitness, three females and four males. I’d taken
Kirstin’s advice and invited Àkbä who surprised me by accepting.
Zithôra was there to meet Zoltan and me too; and they had brought
many high priests and priestesses. The fog melted our clothes and
it was difficult to see anything clearly; at first, I thought I was
alone with Zithôra. But gradually I became aware of other flesh
pressing in upon us. The priestess had been servicing my lob with
sensational skill when I noticed, by a particular trembling of her
lips and slight jarring of her head, that someone was pounding her
from behind, doggy-style. I felt a sharp pain in my rectum and
suddenly realized that I had been penetrated from behind. Before I
could protest, Zithôra resumed her attentions to my knob-end with
such sublime verve that I momentarily forgot the other
sensations—perhaps they merged into a single erotic amphimixis,
until pleasure and pain were indistinguishable. I thought someone
had pushed her nipple into my mouth—a large nipple—but by the time
I saw it was in fact a penis, the kaleidoscopic exchanging and
interchanging of body parts had overtaken us. Caught up in a welter
of erotic sensations so keen and overwhelming that they displaced
all other thoughts, I no longer cared but simply rode along with
the buffeting flow of feelings. I didn’t even care whose penis it
was.</p>
<p class="c5">Several quite bizarre impressions occurred to me
during the experience: of being Zithôra, of being Kirstin, of being
Àkbä. At one point, though, I had the strangest fantasy: of Zithôra
smiling then shoving her face down hard against my chest. I
screamed and, when she held her face up to mine, I saw blood
dripping from her lips and chin, something caught between her
teeth. She had taken a bite out of my flesh; and her eyes gleamed
with a strange light…</p>
<p class="c5">Afterwards, we gathered outside the fog, all of us
exhausted. I was relieved to find no teeth marks of any kind on my
chest (it had all just been a mystical experience!). Àkbä announced
that he had decided to promote Kirstin on the spot and would be
taking her with him, to lend her much-needed skills elsewhere in
the Resettlement Program. We all hugged and kissed Kirstin and
wished her good luck. Àkbä again praised my work in preparing her
and said, “I have to return to the Palace of Justice, where my
services are awaited. I leave you to your work, Sam. Good luck!”
With that, he was gone; and I was left, once more, to my own
devices. No one spoke much; and nothing was said about the group
experience. It was just as well. I wasn’t sure I wanted to talk
about mine, either.</p>
