<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_19">Chapter 18 New World</h2>
<p class="c5">I was starting to get uncomfortable on the floor. So
I asked Sylvia if it would be all right if I got up. “Sure,” she
said, waving me to the co-pilot’s seat.</p>
<p class="c5">Watching through the space-shield sitting above the
control panel, I could see that we were approaching something
resembling a dark disk about the size of a tennis ball. The tennis
ball gradually transformed itself into a black baseball, then a
basketball. “Brutal Ardor,” Brian Eno’s variation on the Pachelbel
<em class="calibre3">Canon</em>, unfolded slowly, inescapably echoing in my memory
as I stared at the shape. When I realized that what I was seeing
was an orb, it occurred to me that it was probably some moon or
satellite. Mostly the color of black tar, its surface contained
several dark brown blobs and patches, the color of nicotine stains.
The place was uninviting and ugly. Just looking at it made me sick
to my stomach.</p>
<p class="c5">We descended through a swirling storm of black soot.
As she set the ship down, Sylvia holstered her blaster.</p>
<p class="c5">“We’re here. After you, Sam.”</p>
<p class="c5">The hull portal opened and we stepped off the
mini-ship. Our eyes slowly met with a bleak, forbidding landscape
like something out of a nightmare: strange, corkscrew-like rock
formations, some of them more than a hundred feet tall, rose up
everywhere we turned; these twisted accretions and the barren
ground out of which they grew looked like they were covered with a
virulent tar or creosote. A sky the color of gunmetal, inflexible
and harsh, without depth or variation, blurred homogeneously at the
horizon. No living thing stirred. A defensive shudder rippled down
my spine. “Where are we?” I asked Sylvia.</p>
<p class="c5">“Home,” she whispered. Tears welled up in her brown
eyes.</p>
<p class="c5">Home? What did she mean by that? The blunt
realization slowly dawned on me, like a pang of remorse. All of a
sudden I got weak in the knees and felt like I might leave my body.
This…<em class="calibre3">this</em> was Earth, the Home of Mortal Man, which Sylvia
and I were standing on.</p>
<p class="c5">“The Joracians have been using it as a dumping
ground for toxic wastes.” Sylvia explained to me, slowly and
carefully, how the Joracians were basically intergalactic
marauders, entrepreneurial pirates who ravaged every planet they
encountered, stripping it of all resources until they had sucked
the system dry, leaving behind only a burnt husk of devastation and
waste.</p>
<p class="c5">It was appalling. No clouds were visible overhead.
There was no sky, no atmosphere of any kind. There was not a blade
of grass or so much as a dandelion. No bird sang, no gnat buzzed,
and no squirrel stirred. Everything was dead and cold. Alluring
Gaia—he Blue Marble we had both adored—was now reduced to nothing
but a cinder, a terrible cipher. “Do you think all the animals are
gone, Sam?”</p>
<p class="c5">I had no idea what to tell her. My own
complicity—duplicity!—in this catastrophe was oppressive, to say
the least.</p>
<p class="c5">“They can’t all be wiped out, can they?” Sylvia
suppressed a few sniffles.</p>
<p class="c5">“There’s no Resettlement Program?” I carped. I still
could not believe it.</p>
<p class="c5">Sylvia was fighting hard to hold back her tears.</p>
<p class="c5">“This is their Resettlement Plan!” she declaimed in
frustration.</p>
<p class="c5">I remembered now, with a chill, what Àkbä had told
me about the Joracian traitors: “Oh, they’ll be reconstructed and
returned to useful productivity.” <em class="calibre3">This was the higher activity
and purpose for which human beings had to be…retooled!</em> It was
all a cynical euphemism for…<em class="calibre3">the Reconstruction of Nature!</em>
I saw now why Joracians had expunged all the writings of Perry
Miller and Hannah Arendt. They had known—had seen—oo much! Their
works—ike George Orwell’s “Politics and the English Language” and
<em class="calibre3">Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>—might have tipped someone off to the
likely machinations of the Joracian High Command.</p>
<p class="c5">Someone like me.</p>
<p class="c5">We walked around, dismally, for a time, but could
detect no change or variation in the landscape wherever we went.
The ground was sticky, the color of coal.</p>
<p class="c5">“Let’s get out of here,” I said.</p>
<p class="c5">But Sylvia sat down on a black rock. “I’m not
leaving.”</p>
<p class="c5">She had made up her mind to do whatever she could to
bring the trashed planet back to life. Sylvia couldn’t believe that
some life—animals or something—had failed to survive. I couldn’t
talk her out of staying.</p>
<p class="c5">Leaving Sylvia there on that barren rock that had
once been the planet Earth was the hardest thing I’d ever done. I
didn’t think I could bear to tear myself away. I guess I was still
in shock.</p>
<p class="c5">“Bye, Sam,” she said in a hollow voice.</p>
<p class="c5">“Goodbye, Sylvia.”</p>
<p class="c5">When I had walked a few paces away, I stopped. “I’ll
come back for you. I promise.”</p>
<p class="c5">By the time I got to the mini-ship, I knew exactly
what I had to do.</p>
