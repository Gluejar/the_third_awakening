<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_4">Chapter 3 The Joracians</h2>
<p class="c5">The stranger chronicled a queer history. Parts of it
seemed vaguely familiar—due largely, I assumed, to the pieces I had
been reading in the <em class="calibre3">Atlantic Monthly</em> (I decided to renew
my subscription, if ever I got the chance). The stranger’s name was
Àkbä; he described himself as a Third Level Joracian. Parts of his
story, as I said, had to do with recent Earth history; these were
the parts I seemed to understand—although what the food chain had
to do with military spending, or top forty songs with American
decision-making (as he implied) remained beyond my grasp. Àkbä made
much, as well, of some peculiar connection between the dreams of
domestic animals, suburban architecture, and political struggles in
the Less Developed Nations—this, too, I utterly failed to parse.
But the rest of his story—I was left behind here—involved a game,
sort of like the Olympics, being played in a remote constellation.
This game related to physics—or poetry—and it not only affected,
but was also influenced by, events in every part of the cosmos,
including those on Earth. But then, no, you see, it wasn’t really a
“game” at all…I shook my head in perplexity.</p>
<p class="c5">Àkbä shortened his tale. “We decided to evacuate
everyone.” By “everyone” I gathered he meant: everyone on
Earth.</p>
