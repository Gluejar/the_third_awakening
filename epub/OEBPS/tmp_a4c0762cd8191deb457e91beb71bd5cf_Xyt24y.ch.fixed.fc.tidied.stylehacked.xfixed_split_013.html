<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_14">Chapter 13 Virtual Reality</h2>
<p class="c5">Now the timetable seemed to speed up. No sooner had
I prepared each group of Earthlings for their new autonomy than
Àkbä appeared, absorbing the entire flock of recruits in a great
golden sphere, which subsequently vanished. My mentor explained
that they were being transported to the next phase of their
resettlement. I was beginning to grow curious about this “next
phase” but never said anything to Àkbä about it. Finally, after I
had completed a grueling tour of fifty communes, Àkbä placed his
hand on my shoulder: “Sam, it’s time you got to see the results of
your labor.” With that, everything around us began to dissolve; I
sensed I was about to enter a new phase of my journey and
experience.</p>
<p class="c5">Once again, our means of locomotion was
unprecedented. “Time is not merely multidirectional,” Àkbä quietly
informed me, “but a Vortex which renders all dimensions permeable
to thought.” He laughed gently at my apparent puzzlement. The
entire process was easily reducible to a set of Galanx equations,
so named after the seven-year-old Joracian mathematician who, in
the 60th Tir or cycle of Joracian history, had first discovered
them. When I told him I didn’t see how that could explain the
physical transporting of our bodies through vast stretches of
space-time, he simply said: ‘Thought is physical existence.” It
took a moment for the fact that I distinctly heard him tell me
this—even as I watched his motionless lips—to sink in. <em class="calibre3">And the
Vortex is the key to Universal Servicing</em>.</p>
<p class="c5">We stood inside a shimmering curtain or column of
light a few feet in diameter. Nothing was visible beyond the
wavering colors surrounding us. Àkbä was standing with his back to
me; when he turned around, he was holding two blue hyböls, one of
which he handed to me. It seemed to have a tiny parasol sticking
out of the top; but as I looked more carefully at the object, I
realized it was something painstakingly carved out of a fruit or
vegetable of some kind, as delicate as origami—and edible! It
tasted like apple. “Sit down,” my companion directed. A most
comfortable-looking barca-lounger invited me to put my feet up.
There was one for my friend, too. He joined me, reclining. When we
had finished our hyböls, he placed a tablet in my hand. “Chew this.
And make sure you swallow the juice.”</p>
<p class="c5">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="c5">“It’s like gum,” he explained.</p>
<p class="c5">I did as he suggested; it tasted like fire.</p>
<p class="c5">“You want another hyböl?”</p>
<p class="c5">“Sure.” I was beginning to feel good. He handed me
another. I don’t know where he was getting them from.</p>
<p class="c5">“Now, Sam,” Àkbä said when I had finished my drink,
“it’s very important that you listen to what I’m going to tell you
and that you remember. I’m going to seem to leave you for awhile,
but in point of fact I’ll be very close to you. I’ll be in
telepathic connection with you throughout, but you’ll feel like
you’re alone. Okay?” I had no idea what he was babbling about. ‘You
won’t be able to touch anything,’ he mentioned.</p>
<p class="c5">‘Why not?’ I grinned.</p>
<p class="c5">‘Because we’re out of our bodies.’</p>
<p class="c5">I turned around and—sure enough!—there I was,
reclining in the lounge chair, my blue hyböl clenched firmly in my
claw, a grin plastered on my mug as I stared straight ahead into
empty space. Àkbä sat coolly next to me, both of us motionless as
ice.</p>
<p class="c5">I experienced a pleasant floating sensation as the
column of colored lights began to spin, vibrate weirdly and reshape
itself. Objects upon which my eyes could focus appeared and I let
myself watch with absorbed fascination. Larger than life, like
titanic gods and goddesses, their faces like moons and suns, their
figures appeared to me; I listened to their conversation with the
half-guilty feeling of a spy or voyeur; but this soon wore off, as
I was drawn, deeper and deeper into the scenes I watched with
increasing amazement and curiosity. Why was the young woman crying?
Suddenly, I recognized the face: it was Kirstin! And the woman she
was talking to was her mother, I now intuited: they had been
reunited! While the great drama unfolded, I recognized others with
whom I had worked and slowly came to understand that they had moved
on to further stages of the Resettlement Process, were reuniting
with loved ones all across the universe. Grasping how important my
preparatory work had been, I could feel tears welling up in my
eyes, until I realized that—disembodied as I was—these were simply
“ghost” tears, like the somatic “tingling” of those with amputated
limbs. As I watched the intimate stories of each person briefly
unfold, I beheld an extended glimpse of the tremendous harmony and
dignity of each life; and I felt an intimate acquaintance and
kinship with the Joracian ideals of service and duty, of Clej Ameo.
The coloI rful images and sounds swirling all around me gradually
faded away; and I found myself back in my body in the
barca-lounger, holding my hyböl. Exhausted, I sat shrunken by this
experience of Sublime Encounter. I quickly drained the rest of my
hyböl. Àkbä sat serene in his composure. “You see, Sam, your labor
has not been in vain.”</p>
<p class="c5">I needed sleep. I told Àkbä this and returned to my
mini-ship alone.</p>
