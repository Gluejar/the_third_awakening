<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_20">Chapter 19 The G-Spot</h2>
<p class="c5">The mini-ship’s navigational system was preset to
take me any place I desired to go in the whole Universe. The Cosmic
“Games” of the Master Joracians transpired continuously in the
Fifth Dimension, in a kind of eternal <em class="calibre3">Urzeit</em>. I headed for
the G-Spot now; it was my firm intention to do everything in my
power to interrupt or alter the basic constituents of cosmic
reality. I didn’t know precisely how I was going to do that or what
I’d find when I got there; but I knew that it was the center of
power and that, if I could receive a hearing before the race of
Master Joracians anywhere, it would be there, at the site and
source of their Sacred Games. I think I had a vague notion of
making some sort of poetic spectacle—a piece of performance art, I
guess.</p>
<p class="c5">As my mini-ship whirled along its trajectory through
the continuum of space-time, I summoned all of my inner resources,
whatever internalized forces for good I could muster. I closed my
eyes and I suppose I must have prayed, though I don’t remember the
words I used, or even if they were words. I didn’t know what to
expect when I reached the Games, or how I would recognize them, or
what anything might look like when I finally got there. Suddenly,
everything was very, very still. I knew I had “arrived” the moment
I blacked out…</p>
<p class="c5">I found myself at the crux of a huge amphitheater or
coliseum. I was vaguely aware of titanic, oblique faces of Joracian
Masters, my Judges, beyond the ringed lights that gradually came up
all around me—it would be here that the ultimate constituents of
reality would be determined, and the course of cosmic history
influenced or altered. Above our heads stretched an enormous
crystal dome, whose sole purpose I sensed preternaturally must be
one of sheer magic. Instinctively, I knew at once that I was in
telepathic communion with the Joracian Masters. Somehow I also knew
(did <em class="calibre3">They</em> tell me?) that I would have to make my case in
poetry, that whatever words I breathed into being would emblazon
and animate the crystal dome above our heads. It was incumbent on
me to create, immediately, a poem so crushingly beautiful and pure
that the Joracian Entelechy would see at once the necessity of
sparing all the poor foolish mortals, my kinsmen, brothers and
sisters, parents and children. I closed my eyes and took a deep
breath; then slowly opening them, I saw the darkness lift a little,
as a white-hot beam glowed upon my face, then grew to include my
whole body, and my voice rose, musical at first, then more resonant
and melodious…</p>
<p class="western1"><img src="tmp_a4c0762cd8191deb457e91beb71bd5cf_Xyt24y_html_m1c43abf1.png" id="graphics3" alt="tmp_a4c0762cd8191deb457e91beb71bd5cf_Xyt24y_html_m1c43abf1.png" class="calibre5"/></p>
<p class="c5">No, no (I thought: that wasn’t right). I licked my
lips, blinked my eyes, and tried again.</p>
<p class="western1"><img src="tmp_a4c0762cd8191deb457e91beb71bd5cf_Xyt24y_html_m7ddd121b.png" id="graphics4" alt="tmp_a4c0762cd8191deb457e91beb71bd5cf_Xyt24y_html_m7ddd121b.png" class="calibre6"/></p>
<p class="c5">But this was really no better. I surmised that my
time was running out, however indulgent my Joracian Hosts might be.
The mother of invention. Necessity was. All right, then, I thought:
very well. And, taking a deep breath…</p>
<p class="western1"><img src="tmp_a4c0762cd8191deb457e91beb71bd5cf_Xyt24y_html_3c25fe34.png" id="graphics5" alt="tmp_a4c0762cd8191deb457e91beb71bd5cf_Xyt24y_html_3c25fe34.png" class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="c5">Yes, I thought: That’s the stuff. That’s more like
it.</p>
<p class="c5"><img src="tmp_a4c0762cd8191deb457e91beb71bd5cf_Xyt24y_html_m1b36e240.png" id="graphics6" alt="tmp_a4c0762cd8191deb457e91beb71bd5cf_Xyt24y_html_m1b36e240.png" class="calibre8"/></p>
<p class="c5">That “obtrude,” I wondered: was it right? I couldn’t
remember exactly what it meant, but felt instinctively that it must
be the right word. It was best, I thought, just to barrel my way
through, trusting to sound; I could hardly stop now.</p>
<p class="c5"><img src="tmp_a4c0762cd8191deb457e91beb71bd5cf_Xyt24y_html_m5da4dffc.png" id="graphics7" alt="tmp_a4c0762cd8191deb457e91beb71bd5cf_Xyt24y_html_m5da4dffc.png" class="calibre9"/></p>
<p class="c5">Then, for the first time since I had begun to speak,
to recite—to create!—the words and sounds that poured through my
mind, ordering themselves by an almost unconscious discipline, I
noticed that the words flooded forth, taking color and shape in the
crystal dome above my head; that the lines hovered, shining and
unbroken, on the expanse of the Great Dome itself. Like some shaman
or bard of old, I sang as in a trance, no longer composing words or
lines but articulating all the pain and anguish, sorrow and hope
and beauty from some place deep inside myself as pure sophisticated
images flooded through me, a mere conduit of psychic energy,
filling the crystal welkin. Timeless, unaware of the passing of
time, I stood outside the natural order of birth and death, outside
my own birth, as a spectator. I sensed the faces of my Judges
gazing upward toward the dome, transfixed by the images I drew to
their attention. I sensed too, as I sang, that their alien hearts
were wrung with pity and compassion for all humanity; that in their
infinite mercy they could and would undo this Great Injustice, and
restore us to our home on earth, to our struggle to create a place
of safety for the newborn, from which generations might strive to
establish sane and generous societies, praising all humane
industry, art and science to which the love of men and women foster
gentle decency and devotion. As a final touch, I prayed that they
would not permit us to become the unwitting victims of a final
murderous rage, engulfing the universe, but would give us back our
mortal home of water, grass and wind, the golden light of summer
afternoons, crisp newly fallen snow on moonlit winter nights, the
Harvest Moon in October, the V of geese seeking another Spring…</p>
<p class="c5">When I had finished, I knew that some momentous
decision was about to be made, that the Judges were in a hubbub,
disconcerted, perhaps in disarray (had I somehow angered them
inadvertently?), but this lasted only for a fleeting moment, as my
own consciousness, exhausted from this epic trial, began to split
apart, shatter or dissolve; and the enormous oblique faces of the
Old Judges swarmed and whirled about me. I could feel myself
getting dizzy and dizzier, my face and hands and feet begin to
tingle and grow numb, as I struggled to postpone but finally could
not resist the uncontrollable wave of sleep that now overtook
me…</p>
