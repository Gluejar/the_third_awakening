<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_12">Chapter 11 The CEO Club</h2>
<p class="c5">I awoke to find my Joracian guide manning the
controls of the mini-ship, his face tremulous with barely
controlled excitement, a ferocious intensity in his eyes that gazed
steadily ahead. The Universe looked like a fireworks display, with
tiny red and green and blue explosions going off randomly, and
colorful lines like trails of jubilant sparklers spiraling in every
direction as we whirled through the space-time continuum. There was
also in Àkbä’s visage something else, a quality I could not quite
put my finger on—was it Courage? Independence? I regarded his face
more closely; he seemed oblivious to my presence: Àkbä had a lean,
gaunt face with high cheekbones, an expansive brow, a sharp
aquiline nose like the beak of a falcon or an eagle, a mouth whose
thin lips might have suggested cruelty were it not for the obvious
goodness which radiated from his entire face (and which had been
demonstrated to me so often that it was secure beyond all doubt of
the character which lay behind this face). I realized that my
friend perfectly embodied what I had always imagined Sherlock
Holmes must look like. Last, I noted his eyes: hazel they were, at
times appearing gray, at others blue, and gleaming with
intelligence and integrity.</p>
<p class="c5">“Where’re we headed?” I asked after a while.</p>
<p class="c5">“To a very special place indeed,” he replied
somewhat mysteriously. I said nothing further, waiting to see what
might transpire.</p>
<p class="c5">All motion stopped and suddenly we were inside a
gargantuan structure, on a circular ramp that winded dizzyingly up
and upward, ever more steeply. I ventured a cautious glance over
the edge of the ramp: an enormous canyon plummeted beneath my gaze,
but I thought I caught a glimpse of a shimmering fountain or
waterfall below, and the slow scuttling of ant-like figures which I
took for humans. “This way!” Àkbä exclaimed as he whisked me down a
narrow appending corridor where we stopped before a strange door or
contraption. Àkbä drew back several sliding screens, from left to
right, top to bottom, bottom to top, and right to left, revealing a
large circular portal that vaguely resembled the shutter of a
gigantic camera. My friend slid a blue card into a panel slot and
the shutter opened! “After you,” my host invited graciously, an
open palm. I crawled into the dark passage; he followed me in and
the portal shut with a snap. The chamber seemed large though I
could see nothing clearly. Before I could speak a word, this
chamber began to revolve, faster and faster—it was like being
inside a clothes drier, without the heat!—and we tumbled, head over
heels, but before we could sustain any injury (the walls of the
cylinder were padded with a soft substance like foam rubber), we
began to float, as though weightless. I became dimly aware too of a
linear motion, in addition to the revolutions (which grew less
noticeable in our gravity-less state). We rocketed along at a
tremendous velocity (or so I inferred); but whether we proceeded
up, down or sideways, I could not determine with any accuracy.</p>
<p class="c5">Abruptly, all motion ceased, the shutter opened and
Àkbä hopped out. I followed suit and, as I sprang out the aperture
of the chamber, found us standing before a wide arched entrance,
beyond which I could make out a murmur of many pleasant voices.
This was where the Third Level Joracian Corps of Elite Officers met
socially, Àkbä explained. I was about to participate in something
he termed “The Rite of Vision.” Without more ado, I was ushered in
through the golden archway to what my friend casually referred to
as the CEO Club…</p>
<p class="c5">Inside the Club, a multitude of Joracian males and
females of the highest distinction and rank were engaged in what
looked like a New York cocktail party. Nearly everybody carried a
clear, round flask, test tube or beaker, the upper end of which
tapered off into an elbow straw. Each contained a smoky, gauzy,
fog-like elixir, called a hyböl, each a different primary color,
although some were white and milky looking. Out of each of the
beakers or flasks protruded what I at first took for a tiny
parasol; but on closer inspection, I saw that it was in fact
something different.</p>
<p class="c5">I was at first struck by the singular physical
beauty and vigor of this company; everyone seemed youthful,
brimming with vitality and exuberance. The Joracian females wore
gorgeous diaphanous gowns composed of the multicolored cellophane
strips (with the little embedded icons I had mistaken for tab-tops)
that stopped just above the knee. Beneath the gown, one caught just
a hint of bikini bra and panties, or perhaps a bare breast, a brown
nipple or a charcoal swatch of pubic hair below the tummy; but as
the cellophane strips of each gown and the motion of its wearer
visually mediated this, I could not be certain about any of it.
Beautiful golden sandals, which rose and tied four or five inches
above the ankle, adorned the feet of these female CEO’s, as well.
Everyone was chattering and flirting and laughing. Àkbä handed me a
large blue beaker and bade me sip through the straw end. “The Rite
of Vision,” he said with a wink. I sipped: it tasted wonderful,
cold and refreshing, something like champagne only more robust; but
there was a slight aftertaste vaguely reminiscent of Windex. After
the third or fourth sip, I no longer noticed the aftertaste.</p>
<p class="c5">The men, I now observed, all wore ornate party-hats,
the intricate designs of which, from a distance, resembled the
fliers, brochures and “hook” letters of direct mail marketing.
Drawing closer, however, I could see that I was in error about
this: what I mistook for letters were in reality only meaningless
glyphs and ciphers. There were splashes of color and intriguing
designs that, while superficially resembling images, were
nonobjective; although they caught and held one’s eye impressively
at first, they went nowhere and were meaningless. At least, they
held no particular meaning for me. Perhaps, though, it was
otherwise for the Joracians.</p>
<p class="c5">The females seemed to sport Hawaiian lais about
their necks and breasts. This too I knew surely could not be the
case; and, as I drew close to one or two of them, I saw plainly
that what I had mistaken for lais was in fact an ornamental collar,
sewn into the cellophane itself, and denoting the rank of the
female CEO.</p>
<p class="c5">Àkbä introduced me to a select clique of male and
female CEO’s.</p>
<p class="c5">“So,” one of the females said, “you’re the Geospo—I
mean, the Earthling—we’ve heard so much about.”</p>
<p class="c5">“Sam is an Earth-Poet,” Àkbä informed the company.
Once more: the breathless silence and wide-staring eyes. I had not
yet gotten used to this, the typical response of Joracians.</p>
<p class="c5">When I questioned the company about their particular
contributions to Joracian society and culture, the conversation got
a little strange. The CEO’s were engaged in communications in some
way or other; though precisely what any of them actually did seemed
to evade specific description. They all seemed to work grueling
hours, laboring in teams, manipulating mountains of data, consuming
massive quantities of food and drink in the process; for what
purpose or end result, though, I could not clearly determine from
their oral accounts.</p>
<p class="c5">One of the female Joracians, a comely sprite named
Daredroola, worked on a team that had designed the attractive hats
worn by the men today. Yørg, a male, had a sudden inspiration; for
he exclaimed: “Who has put a pubic hair on my hyböl?” The CEO’s in
our group all broke into mad, gut-wrenching laughter at this, the
women as well as the men. Only one of the females, a sultry-eyed
brunette named Sulkie, hung back a little, a smidgen aloof. She now
watched me with great curiosity.</p>
<p class="c5">“Sam will be preparing the Earth-evacuees for IRP,”
Àkbä disclosed to the group. If I had thought them awestruck and
wide-eyed before, I soon had a new measure, as the Joracian men
were simply stricken with sick envying looks, the females closing
around me, their hands reaching out to caress my raiment, breasts
heaving against my sides, chest and shoulder-blades (I even felt a
hard nipple here and there!). As the men dropped away, I saw my
mentor grin and wink at me as he receded from view.</p>
<p class="c5">The female CEO’s bombarded me with a million
questions I could not comprehend, but which seemed unswervingly to
suggest that the project on which I had embarked lay beyond the ken
of any Joracian.</p>
<p class="c5">“Did you find it…well, <em class="calibre3">hard</em>, Sam?”
Daredroola asked in a long, luxurious whisper. “<em class="calibre3">You</em> know,”
she said, licking her lips slowly, her eyes starting to cross as
her face bobbed closer to mine. “You <em class="calibre3">know</em>.”</p>
<p class="c5">I wasn’t sure I knew at all…. But I had no time to
reflect, as the throng of females pressed closer. The questions
flew at me faster and faster.</p>
<p class="c5">“What about support? You can’t do this <em class="calibre3">all
alone</em>,” a seductive voice crooned, as someone’s hand—so thick
the crush of sweet, warm flesh on mine, I had no way to tell whose
hand it was—reached through my robe and found my dong! Cool fingers
began gently stroking and massaging me with all the familiar
intimacy of an old flame.</p>
<p class="c5">“Yes, Sam, why, you’ll need oodles and gobs of help
with all the Networking,” another said.</p>
<p class="c5">“<em class="calibre3">Oodles and Gobs, Oodles and Gobs</em>,” several
began chanting like zombies.</p>
<p class="c5">I felt my feet leave the ground as the party of
female Joracians lifted and carried me away, along a curving
corridor, continuing to question me even as they bore me aloft.</p>
<p class="c5">“Have you feasted on the Ortho-Aesthetic Body?”</p>
<p class="c5">“How many combines do you personally own?”</p>
<p class="c5">“Whaddya wanna be when you grow up, Sam?”</p>
<p class="c5">“Won’t you share one of your lovely poems with us?”
I was dimly aware of sniggering and derisive laughter; but I soon
found myself in a dark room, floating and bobbing as if suspended
mid-air in a sea of writhing, tangled, female bodies. The only
light visible was that of a blue geometric plane a few inches thick
on which our bodies were suspended; this plane moved and curved
with our corporal motions; but what the source of that light might
have been, I had no idea.</p>
<p class="c5">“Uh-<em class="calibre3">mm</em>, a-<em class="calibre3">aa</em>-ahh, which–I mean,
<em class="calibre3">what</em> poem—” The cool fingers were joined by a thumb, and
began caressing my handle with exquisite judgment, now pulling and
tugging with brief frenzied vigor, now slowing, settling into a
firm, throbbing tug…</p>
<p class="c5">“—should ah-<em class="calibre3">ah</em>–I <em class="calibre3">recite</em> for you?”
I doubted that I could even remember a poem. A blue breast and
darkened nipple waved mysteriously near my lips; I reached out and
lay my hands along each side of its great bulbous contour, flicking
the nipple with my tongue. As I did so, I heard someone emit a
great long sigh like a hiss of steam.</p>
<p class="c5">I decided on “Masters &amp; Johnson”; it was short,
after all. I summoned all my strength and my very best voice and
recited the following:</p>
<p class="c5"> <br class="calibre4"/></p>
<p class="c6">AFTER PERUSING MASTERS &amp; JOHNSON UNTIL LATE AT
NIGHT</p>
<p class="western1"> <br class="calibre4"/></p>
<p class="c7">Here's a psychic insight<br class="calibre4"/>
Guaranteed to make flesh creep:<br class="calibre4"/>
Too tired to make love and yet<br class="calibre4"/>
Too wired to go to sleep.</p>
<p class="c7"> <br class="calibre4"/></p>
<p class="c5">The nipple was now elongated, blue and stiff; my
tongue flicked and darted feverishly at it, inspiring audible moans
like bruised little thunderclouds about my ears. The cool tentacles
pulling and manipulating my penis were replaced by another,
different set of sensations, a wet and vaguely suffocating
pressure. I sucked a hard blue nipple into my mouth, pinning it
flat with my tongue. When the breast circled away on a new orbit,
Daredroola (the breast and nipple I had licked belonged to
<em class="calibre3">her</em>!) pulled my face close to hers, pressing her hot full
lips hard against mine, touching my tongue with hers as we
kissed.</p>
<p class="c5">Every way I turned, on each side, there were new
combinations of hands and feet and bottoms, lips and legs and
masses of tousled hair to contend with, all writhing with
excitement and pleasure. I had only to reach out for my hands to be
filled with heaving breasts, to lick my lips for my tongue to meet
the dewy circle of another’s mouth. The female CEO’s were
insatiable and wonderfully devoted to pleasing; no sooner had I
shaken off one worshipping caress or devoted mouth than another
clambered instantly on, seizing hard the opportunity like some wild
sea-beast feasting on succulent mollusk-morsels. If I merely
stroked a buttock floating by, it pressed itself like a pillow to
my face; if I touched or stroked a pudendum, the legs spread wide
apart like mandibles of an arachtoid-Schwarzenegger, or
muscle-bound pincers of some colossal scorpion Steve Reeves;
glistening vulvae blossoming and unfolding like the petals of a
rose; ripe meat of exotic alien fruit, drawing ever closer to my
lips and tongue; the clitoral worm already squirming and writhing
and throbbing in anticipation of shared ecstasy. Pairs of eyes of
every shape and color swarmed about me like scavenger fish, darting
this way and that, long lashes and short, their eyelids drooping
and blinking like fireflies on a hot July night. Eyes of Joracian
maidens shaped like almonds, like jewels, like orbs spun around me
in the mystical blue plane of pleasure.</p>
<p class="c5">Then things got weird, as a bizarre geometry of the
erotic invested these events. Joracian females, insatiable lusty
CEO’s every one, lined up inverted along a line, stretching out to
form a single complex “V”; I saw them as one who sees a solitary
image reflected in an infinite array of mirrors, joined at the
unitary point of their communal desire: vaginas extended along a
single trajectory now mutated into a single, multi-faceted muscle,
so that as I penetrated the nearest one at the angular origin of
this Great V, I could feel the crux of my desire throbbing and
pushing deeper and more deeply into all of them,
<em class="calibre3">simultaneously</em>. It was extraordinary, like nothing I had
ever felt or experienced before. Each way I turned, it was a
different partner whose lips and breasts and thighs I saw writhing
before my repeated vigorous thrusts, a different voice and smell of
hair, different hands and heft of breast and buttock and touch of
our mutual, multiple love-making… I wondered if the hyböl contained
some drug that might have had anything to do with this magnificent
hallucination.</p>
<p class="c5">At precisely the moment when I began to suspect that
my passion might last forever, I lost all hope of control; the
mirrors began to melt in a blue thunderclap. I struggled to hold on
tightly to all the images, grasping blue love handles of hips,
breasts, and arms. One by one, they evaporated in a downpour of
shimmering, iridescent rain beyond which I could discern, for the
moment, nothing…</p>
<p class="c5">I found myself lying in a blue mist, my sole partner
the beautiful brunette, Sulkie, collapsed atop me. Her bedroom eyes
were almost closed, though I could see her watching me. Sulkie
batted her long lashes twice and her almond eyes opened wide.
“Pretty good, Earth-man,” she said, licking her lips; then, laying
her cheek next to mine, whispered sultrily: “So <em class="calibre3">whaddya</em> do
fer an <em class="calibre3">encore</em>?” We laughed, but I could feel my cock begin
to swell and throb once again; so I stuck it in quickly and Sulkie
squealed as she threw herself with wild abandon into the
rollicking, rock-n-roll rapture of our mutual dissipation. Tiny
beads of sweat like magnified worlds embellished her forehead, her
eyes strangely focusing and unfocusing as though entranced.
Suddenly she stiffened, her back arched, breasts quivering, her
eyes rolled back and her mouth opened as she emitted a long,
shrieking sob of release. “<em class="calibre3">Aieeyaiyaih!</em>” she exclaimed
through swollen lips, collapsing in a wet heap of bobbling breasts
and tangled hair on my chest.</p>
<p class="c5">In a twinkling, we were arrayed as before, as though
nothing had ever happened. “Come with me, Sam,” Sulkie said, “we
need to talk. Please.” She led me to an empty rooftop garden,
enclosed in a round Plexiglas dome. We sat down in comfortable
chairs. Far above our heads, stars twinkled.</p>
<p class="c5">“Where are we?”</p>
<p class="c5">“The Starlight Roof.” Sulkie had assumed a serious
look. I could see she was preoccupied.</p>
<p class="c5">“Sam,” she began, pausing as though selecting her
words with great care. “You’re a wonderful lover. But I’m worried
about you.”</p>
<p class="c5">“You are? Why?”</p>
<p class="c5">“Because. I care about you.” She sighed, her jaded
expression reminding me of Shirley MacLaine in <em class="calibre3">Irma La
Douce</em>. “I know it goes against everything I’ve been taught,
but…you seem not to have been touched in some essential way by all
of the…um, splendor of Joracian Culture.”</p>
<p class="c5">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="c5">“How long have you known the Joracian who introduced
us?”</p>
<p class="c5">“Àkbä? Well, gee, I’ve known him—it seems
like—forever?”</p>
<p class="c5">Sulkie raised one eyebrow, giving me a sharp
disdainful look.</p>
<p class="c5">“Ever since I was evacuated…”</p>
<p class="c5">“Sam, haven’t you noticed that—well, you’ve been
<em class="calibre3">getting laid</em> a lot lately? Ever since Àkbä took you under
his wing?”</p>
<p class="c5">Had I? I supposed so. But what did that have to do
with—</p>
<p class="c5">Sulkie straightened up suddenly.</p>
<p class="c5">“We’re being watched,” she said in a barely audible
whisper. “Listen to me, Sam: Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac to
these creatures. All the sexual frolic and erotic horseplay at
these functions is mere window-dressing. Sex is just currency to
Joracians. It means nothing to them. To <em class="calibre3">us</em>.” Sulkie
crumpled shortly under the weight of her words. This was her own
culture and people she was talking about. I could see it was hard
for her to talk this way. I put my hand over hers, to offer some
comfort.</p>
<p class="c5">“I don’t have much time,” she continued. “The others
will be looking for us. If anyone asks, just say you wanted to go
someplace quiet where the two of us could talk after the Rite of
Vision. Okay?”</p>
<p class="c5">“Okay.”</p>
<p class="c5">“Don’t get me wrong. Joracian Culture has
accomplished great things. It has made possible the very way of
life, the great goods and privileges that you and I have shared
today. I owe every benefit to Joracian Culture…” Her words recalled
to me the work of Resettlement that Joracian Culture was making
possible. I felt a momentary thrill. But her voice trailed away and
her head sagged on her hands. Hopelessness or dread flashed
painfully across Sulkie’s face. “Don’t let them use you, Sam.” Just
as I noticed with surprise that she was weeping, a voice startled
me.</p>
<p class="c5">Another presence had joined us. It was Àkbä. “Your
Sisters are looking for you.” Nothing but the greatest compassion
was discernible in his tone of voice.</p>
<p class="c5">“I’ll be along in a jiffy,” Sulkie said defiantly.
The figure withdrew. When he was out of earshot, she resumed.
“We’re all <em class="calibre3">whores</em>, Sam.” Sulkie rose and kissed me on the
lips, hugging my body tightly to her breast. “Some of us just have
a higher—or different— price, that’s all.” Under the starlight, her
lips trembled, her face ashen. “Beware the Ortho-Aesthetic
<em class="calibre3">Body!</em>” Then she vanished. Had that been fear in Sulkie’s
voice? She certainly seemed afraid. It had all happened so quickly,
I couldn’t be sure. I felt exhausted, among other things; I wasn’t
at my observational best, and mistrusted my instincts, even my very
senses. And what in the world was the “Ortho-Aesthetic Body”? I
made a mental note to ask Àkbä about it as soon as I got the
chance.</p>
