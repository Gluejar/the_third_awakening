<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_9">Chapter 8 High Tribunal</h2>
<p class="c5">I blacked out again. When I could see, I was
standing beside Àkbä before a strange-looking contraption. As I
looked more closely at it, I could see that it was a kind of door,
rather like a ship’s hatch with a circular handle for opening and
shutting watertight compartments. Except of course this door also
had a console of nine buttons colored blue and green and black.
When it began to emit a low humming sound, Àkbä turned the wheel
once counter-clockwise and the door swung open. I know neither how
we got to our destination nor precisely what our means of
locomotion had been—it was like being shot along a dark tunnel at
tremendous velocity. But there was no real sensation of moving;
only a recollection of a sequence of tiny explosions seen
peripherally. Very pleasant little puffs. I barely had to turn my
head. When I asked him where we were going, Àkbä said: “To the High
Tribunal of the Joracian Council.”</p>
<p class="c5">Then we were there. Side by side, Àkbä and I walked
along. It was no stroll; he kept a brisk pace. The further we went,
the more things opened out. When we had passed down several halls
and crossed an equal number of chambers, I began to get an idea of
just how monumental was the structure that housed this Council. The
lighting was uneven; rooms you were moving toward seemed dark until
you reached them. The walls were littered with ornamentation,
colorful graphic images of every shape and size. Though I caught
only fleeting glimpses of them, I was struck by the fact that none
of these images was recognizable to me.</p>
<p class="c5">Àkbä instructed me as we made our way toward the
inner sanctum. A trial of three Joracians was being conducted, he
explained—I could see that he was worried about it; his counsel was
terse. These three Joracians were charged with treason. They were
deadly foes of Earthmen. The reason for my attendance at this
spectacle was soon made clear to me. “I want you to observe their
behavior very carefully,” my friend said.</p>
<p class="c5">The High Tribunal of Joracians was in session.
Everyone wore the “imperial uniform of judgment,” as my host
referred to it—everyone, that is, except me. I was a little
uncomfortable in the new blue suit that had, in a twinkling,
replaced my tunic, for I knew that I “stood out” in this regal
gathering.</p>
<p class="c5">My uniform was impressive, to say the least: it
consisted of a flowing robe of bright blue cellophane with
naugahyde epaulets from which streamed plastic strips of different
lengths and colors. Embedded in the cellophane were long chains of
what appeared to be tab-top rings. On closer inspection, it was
obvious this was not what they were at all; nevertheless, the
coincidental resemblance was mystifying.</p>
<p class="c5">Inside the chamber, the din was incredible. The
whole thing reminded me of nothing so much, at first, as an Amway
Convention, everybody talking all at once. I heard the phrase
“Ortho-Aesthetic Body” dropped several times, and wondered what
they were all talking about.</p>
<p class="c5">When the prisoners materialized, Àkbä said
discreetly: “I want you to watch them carefully.”</p>
<p class="c5">It was not easy to tell a Joracian’s age, I soon
discovered—they all looked about thirty-five or forty; but, somehow
or other, I had an intuition that these three were no kids. So it
could be no youthful indiscretion that had brought them to the
dock. No, these were hardened criminals—dangerous rebels! They
stood so calm, gazing stolidly at their surroundings; it was enough
to break my heart. They didn’t even seem to be aware of what they
had done.</p>
<p class="c5">Àkbä asked me to say a few words on behalf of the
Earthlings, so I rose and addressed my words to the conspirators:
“The People of Earth may seem a worthless and perverse lot, but I
assure you, what they most want is to live a life of fulfillment
and personal growth.” I remembered a couple of lines from William
Blake, so I added: “If you have formed a circle to go into, / Go
into it yourself and see how you would do.” My companion regarded
me with astonishment as I sat down.</p>
<p class="c5">A hush had fallen over the entire chamber—what an
audience!—but only momentarily as the prisoners were now summarily
removed. As it happened, the three of them brushed past the table
where I was sitting. One of the rebels paused in front of me just
long enough to say: “You amaze me.” Joracian guards took them away.
I attributed his having been affected to the Blake lines. If he was
that responsive to Blake, then perhaps there was hope for his
rehabilitation, after all.</p>
<p class="c5">“What will become of them?” I asked Àkbä.</p>
<p class="c5">He looked at me a long moment. “Oh, they’ll be
reconstructed and returned to useful productivity.”</p>
<p class="c5">Àkbä took me on a tour of the basilica. It was a
maze of halls, alcoves and atria, winding and interconnected; I was
glad I had him to guide me, or I would have been lost for good. He
told me the names and purposes of the various rotundas, porticos,
vaults and vestibules, but to me they were just big empty rooms.
There were no windows and little light, but—curiously, I
thought—the walls in every chamber were covered with the same
peculiar designs that I had earlier noticed, nonrepresentational
images of every conceivable shape, texture and size. At first I
thought it was some sort of non-objective art, but in a few of them
I could recognize some halfway familiar detail: a human eye, a
fingerprint, a numeral or letter of the alphabet. Though I could
not exactly decipher their meaning, I felt certain that these were
the visible emblems of a truly advanced race, infinitely wise and
kind.</p>
<p class="c5">“That’s exactly right, Sam,” Àkbä said, as if
reading my mind. “Our culture requires us to work in teams,” he
added, by way of explanation, “to promote clarity and
understanding. Many of these teams produce the icons you see around
you.” He stopped and pointed out one design in particular,
mentioning that it had taken all the awards at the recent
games.</p>
<p class="c5">“Games? What are they?” I asked.</p>
<p class="c5">“They’re special convocations to determine the
ultimate constituents of reality.”</p>
<p class="c5">I perked up. “When are they held?”</p>
<p class="c5">“In principle, they cannot be planned for or
scheduled. They occur only under conditions of absolute necessity.
When any of a number of things are cosmically suitable, then it
happens.”</p>
<p class="c5">He must have noticed my puzzlement.</p>
<p class="c5">“Of course, in another sense, the Games go on
continuously…”</p>
<p class="c5">“Where are they held?”</p>
<p class="c5">“In the Fifth Dimension, at the Source of Gravity.
We call it the G-Spot. You see, Sam, consciousness exists
simultaneously on many different levels. Those levels actually
comprise fissures leading into other dimensions. Some part of every
conscious entity is always present in the Fifth Dimension.”</p>
<p class="c5">“How do you figure that?” I asked, somewhat
skeptically.</p>
<p class="c5">“Because: existence on more than one level is a
sufficient condition for existence in the Fifth Dimension.”</p>
<p class="c5">This was more interesting than anything I’d ever
read in a book and I told him so.</p>
<p class="c5">“Sam, your performance earlier pleased me. You’ve
earned a reward. So, if you will follow me—”</p>
<p class="c5">“Where to?”</p>
<p class="c5">“You’ll find out, soon enough.”</p>
<p class="c5">We took a ride in what was the strangest elevator,
or distant cousin to an elevator, I’d ever seen: a pressure-locked
cylinder with portals at either end. The control panel was more
than I could handle; fortunately, my executive friend knew how to
operate it. Instead of going up and down, it revolved like a
carnival ride—although I had a vague sense of lateral motion, like
flying along a pneumatic tube.</p>
<p class="c5">“We use this to bypass wormholes,” Àkbä offered
without further embellishment.</p>
<p class="c5">“The house of poetry has many mansions,” I replied,
intentionally cryptic.</p>
<p class="c5">We had apparently reached one of them when we
stepped out of the elevator into an expansive world of neither
depth nor contour. Not a single familiar object was present, in
spite of there being sufficient light.</p>
<p class="c5">Wherever we were, it had plenty of atmosphere, too:
a gauzy, milky light palpable as thick fog, shifting in an endless
sequence of flat planes, surrounded us as we walked.</p>
<p class="c5">“Where are we?” I asked, only to find that my
companion had disappeared and I was alone. Or not alone, exactly,
for through the milky light, a figure approached…in the shape of a
woman!</p>
<p class="c5">“Welcome to the Temple of Fitness,” she said in a
husky drawl. “I am your high priestess, Zithôra.”</p>
<p class="c5">She was as white and pale as the ambience in which
we floated; bleached ringlets covered her head. Her face was round,
with a pointy little chin. Her alabaster arms were bare and the
wet, gauze-like wrap she wore clung to her body like a second skin,
disclosing the shapely contours of her breasts, stomach and hips
like a Greek lyre. Zithôra’s eyes were large and hypnotic: two blue
fires that penetrated my very soul. Yet I felt strangely at ease
and safe in her presence. She licked her lips in a way I can only
describe as spiritual. When I cleared my eyes to look again, I was
licking those full lips, the priestess’ arms encircling my neck and
back and then…the strangest of all experiences began to happen to
me—to us!—as, I don’t know how else to describe it, our arms and
hands and fingers and eyes had somehow become interchangeable. I
could not tell where she began and I left off, the intensity of our
passion growing exponentially in what was definitely a
sexually-charged yet mystical transfiguration; our love-making both
carnal and transcendent, trading a focused awareness of each of the
body parts whose ownership—each act whose authorship—we exchanged.
In some part of my mind, the whole thing was definitely disturbing
and yet I was completely distracted both by the intensity of the
pleasure we shared as well as by the deep conviction that the
unparalleled event was sublime, even holy. “Who are you?” I heard a
voice asking. It took me a while to realize that the voice was my
own. “I am You,” her voice returned. “I am <em class="calibre3">in</em> You.” “And I
in <em class="calibre3">You</em>.”</p>
<p class="c5">It seemed we were destroyed in the explosions that
followed, the great erotic disintegration that returned us panting,
heaving, sweat-soaked to our separate bodies. We lay in each
other’s arms, Zithôra on top of me. <em class="calibre3">Remember me</em>, I thought
she said. “What was—how did we—do that?” My eyes unclosed. But she
was gone, vanished into the mist as suddenly as she had appeared. I
sat up, not sweating, not breathless. I was wearing my blue suit;
but now, I noticed, a lightning-bolt emblazoned the left arm of my
jacket.</p>
<p class="c5">An air of unreality permeated this place. I rose and
groped my way through the fog. Àkbä found me as I emerged from the
fog’s edge. “Are you ready?” he inquired, point-blank.</p>
<p class="c5">“I guess so,” I said.</p>
