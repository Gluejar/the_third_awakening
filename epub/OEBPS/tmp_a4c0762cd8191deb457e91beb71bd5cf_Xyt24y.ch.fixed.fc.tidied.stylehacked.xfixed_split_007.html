<h2 class="western4" id="calibre_toc_8">Chapter 7 The Hall of Memory</h2>
<p class="c5">Àkbä was waiting for us in the hallway. “There you
are,” he said. “I’ve been looking for you.” “Where are we going?” I
asked. “To the Hall of Memory.” Sylvia could come too.</p>
<p class="c5">By what means of transport we reached the Hall of
Memory, I cannot say. One moment we were bathed in utter blackness;
the next we emerged into a gradually suffused luminescence—the
golden light of late afternoon—of a fair-sized chamber. Though the
room held neither card catalogs nor computer monitors nor stacks of
books, I recognized the ambience at once as only too familiar: we
were in a library! There were a dozen or so oval-shaped pods of a
bluish-green tint. As I approached one, it opened rather like an
oyster’s shell. Within the pod, there were strange controls and a
comfortable-looking seat. I climbed in without hesitation. As the
pod lid began to close, I saw Sylvia climbing into her own pod.</p>
<p class="c5">Sitting in near-darkness, I began to think some
popcorn, raisinettes and a Pepsi might be nice, when suddenly a
female voice asked me (the voice emoted warmth and charm): “What do
you desire?”</p>
<p class="c5">“What works are in this library?” The voice took me
on a brief tour of the control panel, which lay at my fingertips.
It was really quite easy. As I reclined, the controls adjusted
themselves to my angle and position, and the dark ceiling of the
pod became a screen on which images appeared. I had only to speak
the names of authors or titles of works for entire cross-referenced
compilations to appear onscreen, seriatim. A large circular button
allowed me to move through these works, forward or backward in
time; thus, I could examine, virtually as I thought of it, the most
recent scholarship on, say, Charles Dickens, or any and all
occurrences in the popular press related to that body of
literature. Uttering another qualifying command—for example:
“detective story”—and my search would shift in yet another
direction, piling up detailed reference upon reference to Dickens
relevant to that genre. I began immediately to play around with
this remarkable toy until, after a few hours had passed (they
seemed but minutes!), my thinking turned toward the serious
business of “retooling” humankind for their new adventure, as Àkbä
had called it. I wondered if I had the poetic resources for this
new task.</p>
<p class="c5">After what seemed another hour, I was satisfied that
all of the literary treasures to which my fine, Midwestern, liberal
arts education had exposed me were indeed intact, having been
successfully salvaged by Joracian foresight. But there was one
glitch: I could find no reference to the body of works of two
giants, George Orwell and Hannah Arendt. Then I searched for Perry
Miller, author of <em class="calibre3">Errand into the Wilderness</em>, <em class="calibre3">Nature’s
Nation</em>, and a particular hero of mine. <em class="calibre3">Nothing!</em> There
was not the slightest hint that any of these persons had ever lived
or written a word. All reference to them seemed to have been
expunged, as if by some invisible hand and design, deleted or
airbrushed into oblivion. For a moment, a piercing forlorn quality
shot through me like panic and then was gone. Of all works of
philosophy, literature and criticism, these were the ones I felt I
would surely miss the most. It was very odd indeed that they should
go “missing” like this, in my time of need. But I could not take
time to grieve just then. “Let me out,” I said, more weary than I
knew. The pod lid slowly rose and, as I climbed out, I saw that the
Hall of Memory was dark.</p>
