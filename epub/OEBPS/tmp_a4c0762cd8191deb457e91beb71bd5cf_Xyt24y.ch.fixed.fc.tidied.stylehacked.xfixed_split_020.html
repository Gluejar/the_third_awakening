<p class="c5">And I found myself back in the New Stanley, standing
at the bar, my untouched drink before me. I no longer waited for
Vivaldi, as strains of jazz now streamed into my ears. I was not
alone; there were several people standing at the bar, couples
dressed for dinner, sitting at tables, people talking and laughing.
There was no mini-ship, no Resettlement Plan, no Joracian Empire. I
took a sip of my drink—it tasted like formaldehyde. My cigarettes
looked back at me with murderous intent; somehow, I didn’t want
them anymore. The bartender stopped wiping a glass and looked at
me: “About time to bring in the replacement humans, don’tcha
think?” Nodding, I stepped outside into the brisk air of an early
autumn evening, and decided to call Sylvia and find my copy of the
<em class="calibre3">Atlantic Monthly</em>.</p>
